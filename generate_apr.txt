APR requests need to be done through cases. If MAC doesn’t open the case and request an APR by any other mean, OMA has the responisiliby to creat such case request and assign it to themself
Using YPM Report Sudio, OMA generates the regular APR model and complete it with recommendation.
OMA drop the PPT in the case used for the request, as well as in Sharepoint client’s folder.
If client folder not presnet, OMA creates one using the template folder
Naming convention for the APR: SEM-APR-client-name-date-range
